    <h2>Stir-Fries: The OG One-Pan Dinner</h2>
    <p>
      Shrimp make the best stir-fries. One of the trickiest things about cooking shrimp is that they
      can overcook easily, and overcooked shrimp is a real bummer. But! Cooking shrimp in a stir-fry
      is a natural fit for these juicy little crustaceans. A fast fry is the easiest way to cook
      them. Sautéed quickly over high heat, with a flavorful sauce and some veggies, this recipe is
      all but guaranteed to produce perfect shrimp every time. It’s healthy and quick, but it’s also
      a fun dish to throw together for friends—using shrimp makes it feel a little special, and it’s
      easy to make it gluten-free so it accommodates a lot of dietary preferences.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce or tamari</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili sauce, such as sambal oelek</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup snow peas</li>
      <li>2 pounds large raw tail-on shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine the garlic, ¼ cup of water, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil,
        chili sauce, and cornstarch. Whisk to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is glistening, add the
        bell pepper, asparagus, and snow peas. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin
        to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until pink and
        opaque, 3 to 4 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the soy sauce mixture to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is
        slightly thickened and the shrimp and veggies are completely coated, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve over cooked rice, sprinkled with cilantro and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
